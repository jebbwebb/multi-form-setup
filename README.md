The Focus-

Solution-
Through my time researching while working on the project i discover Redux and Router to be perfect solutions for the challenges i was facing.

Tools Used-
React/Redux/Router/CSS
React was the perfect framework to use  for handling all the different options that are presented on the app.


Summary-
The start of this project was a great struggle,however i was quickly able to learn more about the advanced tools react has to offer which has really made me more interested on discoving what react has to offer.
