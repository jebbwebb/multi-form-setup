multi-form-setup-
Mimicks a form you may come across on a subscription based website or app.

The Focus-
The focus of this project was to really test my react skills and more specfically my state management between seperated components.

Challenges-
Having never have worked on a react project with multiple pages and seperate components i struggled with handling all the different states.

Solution-
Through my time researching while working on the project i discover Redux and Router to be perfect solutions for the challenges i was facing. Redux made it so i was able to keep track of  states between seperated components and then finally be able to show the options the user selected in the summary screen. Router helped with the many different ways you can naviagte to other pages on the app.

Tools Used-
React/Redux/Router/CSS-
React was the perfect framework to use  for handling all the different options that are presented on the app.


Summary-
The start of this project was a great struggle,however i was quickly able to learn more about the advanced tools react has to offer which has really made me more interested in discovering what else React and other frameworks can do.
